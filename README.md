# Task Descriptions
Task 1: Application Development Demo and Viva (15 marks) (Group Task)
You will be developing an application for POGS that you have been working on through the other assignments. You will create a basic Online Shopping App.
This list below outlines the requirements that need to be implemented in the application.
1. A Welcome heading displaying the name of the system.
2. An image of your choice displayed below the heading.
3. Vegetables dropdown:
In the first dropdown, provide at least five (5) vegetables. They should contain values like this:
‘Potato-$5’
‘Carrot-$8’
At least two (2) of the items, should have the same price (you can make this up).
For simplicity reasons, we will assume the price to be a single-digit value without any decimal point.
4. Fruit dropdown:
In the second dropdown, provide at least five (5) fruits. They should contain values like this:
‘Orange-$11’
‘Blueberry -$12’
At least two (2) of the items, should have the same price (You can make this up).
For simplicity reasons, we will assume the price to be a double-digit value without any decimal point.
5. Choose Quantity dropdowns:
For each of the chosen item, there is a corresponding quantity. Quantity will have numbers between 1 and 5.
6. Calculate button:
Once the values are selected, when the calculate button is clicked, it should display the total price in a label below with a label:
Total Cost of Order: $ Total Price
7. ‘App developed by names of the group members’ as label at the bottom of the app.
An empty layout of the app is provided in the assignment folder. You are not allowed to add any
extra screens. However, if you want to add extra details on the screen, that is acceptable. You mustchange the look & feel of the app. The application should work without crashing and must display the right output. Please  remember you must also handle non-selections. E.g., The total price should not have a NaN error when calculating the total price.

This task is due for submission on Sunday (19/05/2024 at 11.55 pm).
The Viva will take place in the Week 12 workshops. All group members must attend the workshop in week 12. During this demonstration, you will be asked questions based on the code to test each group’s understanding of the system. If you are not present for the discussion component, you will be awarded zero marks for the entire assignment.
